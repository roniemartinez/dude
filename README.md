# dude uncomplicated data extraction

Dude is a very simple framework for writing a web scraper using Python decorators.
The design, inspired by [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), was to easily build a web scraper in just a few lines of code.
Dude has an easy to learn syntax.

> üö® Dude is currently in Pre-Alpha. Please expect breaking changes.

## Minimal web scraper

The simplest web scraper will look like this:

```python
from dude import select


@select(selector="a")
def get_link(element):
    return {"url": element.get_attribute("href")}
```

The example above will get all the [hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#HTML) elements in a page and calls the handler function `get_link()` for each element.
To start scraping, just simply run in your terminal:

## How to run the scraper

You can run your scraper from terminal/shell/command-line by supplying URLs, the output filename of your choice and the paths to your python codes to `dude scrape` command.

```bash
dude scrape --url "<url>" --output data.json path/to/file.py #(1)
```

## Features

- Simple [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)-inspired design - build a scraper with decorators.
- Uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) API - run your scraper in Chrome, Firefox and Webkit and leverage Playwright's powerful selector engine supporting CSS, XPath, text, regex, etc.
- Data grouping - group related scraping data.
- URL pattern matching - run functions on specific URLs.
- Priority - reorder functions based on priority.
- Setup function - enable setup steps (clicking dialogs or login).
- Navigate function - enable navigation steps to move to other pages.
- Custom storage - option to save data to other formats or database.
- Async support - write async handlers.
- BeautifulSoup4 - option to use BeautifulSoup4 instead of Playwright.

## Support

This project is at a very early stage. This dude needs some love! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Requirements

- ‚úÖ Any dude should know how to work with selectors (CSS or XPath).
- ‚úÖ This library was built on top of [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python). Any dude should be at least familiar with the basics of Playwright - they also extended the selectors to support text, regular expressions, etc. See [Selectors | Playwright Python](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors).
- ‚úÖ Python decorators... you'll live, dude!

## Why name this project "dude"?

- ‚úÖ A [Recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) looks nice.
- ‚úÖ Adding "uncomplicated" (like [`ufw`](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall)) into the name says it is a very simple framework. 
- ‚úÖ Puns! I also think that if you want to do web scraping, there's probably some random dude around the corner who can make it very easy for you to start with it. üòä
