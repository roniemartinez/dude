# dude uncomplicated data extraction

Simple way to write a web scraper using Python decorators.

## Dude, why name this project "dude"?

Inspired by `ufw`, I wanted to add "uncomplicated" into the name with something related to web scraping.

I also think that if you want to do web scraping, there's probably some random dude who can make it very easy for you to start with. ðŸ˜Š

## How to use

### Requirements

1. Any dude should know how to work with selectors (CSS or XPath).
2. This library was built on top of [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python). Any dude should be at least familiar with the basics of Playwright - they also extended the selectors to support text, regular expressions, etc. See https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors.
3. Python decorators... you'll live, dude!

### Installation

### Example

You can run [example.py](example.py) in your terminal using the command `python example.py`.

#### Basics

To use `dude`, start by importing the library.

```python
import dude
```

A basic handler function consists of the structure below. A handler function should accept 1 argument (element) and should be decorated with `@selector()`. The handler should return a dictionary. 

```python
@dude.selector("<put-your-selector-here>")
def handler(element):
    ...
    # This dictionary can contain multiple items
    return {"<key>": "<value-extracted-from-element>"}

```

The example handler below extracts the text content of any element that matches the selector `css=div#rso h3:nth-child(2)`.

```python
@dude.selector("css=div#rso h3:nth-child(2)")
def result_title(element):
    """
    Result title.
    """
    return {"title": element.text_content()}
```

To run your handlers, simply call `dude.run(url=<url-you-want-to-scrape>)`.

```python
dude.run(url="https://www.google.com/search?q=dude&hl=en")
```
